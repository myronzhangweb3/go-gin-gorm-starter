# Go Gin-Gorm Starter Template

Welcome to the Go Gin-Gorm Starter Template repository! This is a robust boilerplate for kickstarting your new web application projects with Go (Golang), leveraging the Gin web framework and Gorm ORM. Designed to offer a well-structured starting point, this template supports two of the most popular relational databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL.

## Features

- **Gin Web Framework**: Enjoy the high-performance and efficient HTTP web framework that Gin provides, making it easy to build scalable and maintainable web applications.
- **Gorm ORM**: Utilize the developer-friendly ORM that supports a wide range of ORM features, simplifying database interactions and CRUD operations.
- **Multiple Database Support**: Whether you are a fan of MySQL or PostgreSQL, this template has got you covered. Easily switch between databases as per your project requirements.
- **Clean Architecture**: The template follows clean architecture principles, ensuring separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Middleware Integration**: Pre-configured middlewares for logging, CORS, and error handling to save you time on initial setup.
- **Migrations**: Database schema migration support that keeps your database structure versioned and in sync with your application.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilize `.env` files for environment-specific configurations, keeping your development, staging, and production settings separate and secure.
- **Docker Support**: Containerize your application with Docker for easy development and deployment.
